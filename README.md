# mathplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Challenge assignment

Please use pymaceuticals.ipynb for this assignment.  The '_starter.ipynb' file was kept in its original state to verify I was on the correct path/ error diagnosis/prevention.

### Code References 
Reference for code used outside of '_starter' file or original thought.  Comment included before line where code was utilized
* Provided by Natural Chan on slack: df.duplicated(), df.isin('stuff'), df.agg() 
* For all plot/statistics I heavily utilized the solved examples from the Module 5 activities- mostly for the formatting and style options
* Stack overslow was utilized for more information on:
    - addition info for boxplot: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/boxplot_demo.html
    - Pearson correlation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13648318/calculating-pearson-correlation?noredirect=1&lq=1

### Other Notes
For the box plot analysis, I created addition plots outside of the challange prompts.  I wanted to visually see initial tumor size, and verify each treatment started with the same tumor size and report if there were any inital outliers from the trial's start.

I also created an additional dataframe to quickly see if how many mice were removed from the trial's records according to time point.
