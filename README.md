Module 5 Challenge assignment

Please use pymaceuticals.ipynb for this assignment.  The '_starter.ipynb' file was kept in its original state to verify I was on the correct path/ error diagnosis/prevention.

### Code References 
Reference for code used outside of '_starter' file or original thought.  Comment included before line where code was utilized
